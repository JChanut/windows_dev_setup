# Python

Python 2 and Python 3 don't get along too well in Windows. Python 2 is necessary for some npm packages which are more important for me that's why I chose to install it.

After installing `python2` make sure, it works. Otherwise try to fix the issues. More to this in `03_manual_work.markdown`

# ConEmu

I've had problems with ConEmu. Check if it installed correctly and try reinstalling it (check exceptions for more information potentially).
